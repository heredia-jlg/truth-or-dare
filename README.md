#Feature contributions:

-Implemented conditional rendering on voting buttons. User can only see buttons once he or she is logged in.

-Designed an elegant and modern home page in order to make the application more appealing and welcoming to the user.

-Constructed a component that updates instantaneously to show the accuracy of a user after each vote. Following usability principles, the user gets feedback when they click on a button; the system tells them that their answer is either right or wrong.

-Created a comment-deletion mechanism. Moderators and administrators of the app have the ability to delete comments on sets. Conditional rendering and usability principles were also applied.

-Improved the usability and looks of the router navigation bar by applying a conventional design, which makes it easier for the user to recognize and use.
